You can also view a specific category or product, all products or products with promotions. And you can add products to the cart and get their amount. The following libraries have been used, such as react-redux, react-thunk, react-router-dom,  react-router-hash-link. If you would like to take a look at my project, please be patient as the hosting of the renders is slow.",
